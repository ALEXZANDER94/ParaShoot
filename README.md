PARASHOOT

I worked on this project as part of my Software Engineering Course. My role in implementing this 2D video game
was coding the Ragdoll Physics for the protagonist of the game. The basis of this game is for the User to
reach the bottom of the screen, this is easier said than done. There are plenty of obstacles that make this
difficult ranging from birds to missiles. Upon reaching 0 health, the game will be over. There are also special
projectiles that help the User in his/her quest to reach the bottom. My group and I carefully coded different
features of the game.

PREREQUISITES

RUNTIME

The game starts with the User taking control of a Ragdoll falling from a plane through the sky. To start, there are 
a small amount of birds flying from one end of the screen to the other. Different colored birds have different
aspects of collision. Some damage more than others, some aid the User. It's up to the User to decide which colors
do what. As the game continues, more and more birds appear at a single instance as well as a few missile projectiles
that make things more difficult for the User. Suffice it to say, the User will have to decide which objects they want
to collide with.
